# Discordmium

## Overview
Discordmium is a Discord bot that brings a Chromium browser instance into Discord. Users can control a virtual browser through Discord slash commands and button interactions.

**Warning**: This bot is meant for self-use only in private servers, as users have full control over a browser instance.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Node.js
- **Main Dependencies**:
  - `eris`: Discord bot library
  - `puppeteer`: Headless Chrome automation
- **Entry Point**: `run.js` (calls the exported function from `index.js`)
- **Structure**:
  - `index.js`: Main bot logic and browser control
  - `utils/plugin.js`: Browser plugin for visual mouse cursor
  - `utils/interactionCollector.js`: Discord interaction handler
  - `run.js`: Bot runner with environment variable loading

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal
- `GUILD_ID`: Discord server ID where the bot will operate

### Bot Setup Instructions
1. **Create a Discord Bot Application**:
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a new application
   - Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
   - Enable "Message Content Intent" under Privileged Gateway Intents
   - Copy the bot token

2. **Invite Bot to Your Server**:
   - In the Developer Portal, go to OAuth2 > URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Attach Files`, `Read Messages/View Channels`
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot

3. **Get Your Server ID**:
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode)
   - Right-click on your server and select "Copy Server ID"

## How It Works
1. Bot connects to Discord using Eris
2. Launches a Puppeteer browser instance
3. Registers a `/browse` slash command for the specified guild
4. Users can interact with the browser through Discord buttons (movement, clicking, typing)
5. Each user session has a time limit (default: 5 minutes)
6. Includes content filtering for suspicious URLs and keywords
